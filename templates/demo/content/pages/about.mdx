# Why This Core Exists

Affiliate.FM publishes independent research, interviews, and tools for performance marketers. We needed a static-friendly stack that anyone—from solo creators to enterprise partner teams—could reuse and upgrade without breaking their content.

## Principles

1. **Stay static** – Astro 5 in static mode keeps hosting simple (Netlify, Vercel, S3, Cloudflare Pages… take your pick).
2. **Prefer conventions** – Routes, locales, and layouts live in predictable directories so you can swap components without touching the router.
3. **Document decisions** – Scripts like `bootstrap` and `update-core` write config files that describe what the “core” layer means for your team.
4. **Default to accessibility + performance** – Light and dark templates share the same markup; typography/contrast already tuned.

## Recommended Flow

1. Clone or `npm create astro@latest -- --template affiliatefm/website-core-template`.
2. `make bootstrap && make seed` to set up config + sample data.
3. Customize content, components, or layouts (anything under `protectedPaths` stays yours).
4. Translate with your workflow (manual, `@affiliate.fm/astro-content-ai-translator`, or other pipelines).
5. Stay fresh with `make update`.

## Toolchain Snapshot

| Area | Stack |
| ---- | ----- |
| UI | Astro Islands + MDX + your framework components |
| Styling | Local styles per layout (no global framework) |
| Content | Astro Content Collections + MDX |
| L10n | Native Astro i18n routing + helper utilities |
| Automation | Makefile, npm scripts, bootstrap/update/seed helpers |
