# Affiliate.FM · Independent Media + Open-Source Tools

We ship reusable building blocks for affiliate, performance, and data-driven content hubs. This template is our core—an Astro 5 starter tuned for static deployments, multi-lingual routing, and a predictable update story.

## What You Get Out of the Box

- **Content-first**: Markdown/MDX via content collections, strictly typed frontmatter, and folder-based locales (no `page.locale.mdx` juggling).
- **Deployment-agnostic**: Static output, zero server adapters required, domain-aware hreflang tags, and robots/sitemap routes already wired.
- **Upgradeable core**: `make update` fetches our latest baseline without touching `src/content`, `src/data`, or anything you mark as protected.
- **Tooling for every skill level**: Makefile commands for beginners, raw npm scripts for CI, and bootstrap/update scripts to document local decisions.
- **Data workflows**: Seedable JSON under `src/data/` plus helper utilities so you can render performance metrics alongside editorial content.

## Layers & Lifecycle

| Layer | Owned By | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** | Affiliate.FM | `src/components`, layouts, routing, integrations, update scripts |
| **User Content** | You | `src/content/pages/**`, locale-specific assets, MDX, custom layouts |
| **User Data** | You | `src/data/*.json`, API fetchers, bespoke pipelines |

Keep core clean so you can `git pull` or `make update` without merge hell. Stash customizations inside user layers or extend the layout via slots/extra components.

### Updating Safely

1. Run `make bootstrap` once per project to generate `affiliatefm.core.json`.
2. Add any paths you never want overwritten (custom integrations, data fetchers, etc.).
3. Pull new goodies any time with `make update`.
4. Inspect the diff, reinstall dependencies if `package.json` changed, rebuild.

### Working With Data

- Store structured data in `src/data/`. The template protects it from future core upgrades.
- Reapply this full demo snapshot any time with `make seed` (`npm run seed:demo`).
- Import via `@/lib/data` helpers or wire your own data loaders.

### Built-in Automation

```bash
make install    # npm install
make dev        # astro dev
make build      # production build + HTML prettify
make check      # astro check / type safety
make seed       # reapply the Affiliate.FM demo snapshot
make update     # pull newest Affiliate.FM core
```

## Next Steps

- Edit `src/config/site.ts` to set locales, nav, and optional per-locale domains.
- Drop your own MDX into `src/content/pages/<<locale>>/`.
- Swap the template skin via `template` in `site.ts` (`basic` vs `basic-dark`).
- Wire AI-assisted translation with `@affiliate.fm/astro-content-ai-translator` using the sample scripts.
