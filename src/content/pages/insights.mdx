# Data & Insights

This page demonstrates how to mix editorial content with structured data. The JSON files under `src/data/` are safe from `make update` and can be generated by your own ETL jobs or by the bundled `make seed` helper.

## Sample Workflow

1. Drop exports from your BI warehouse into `src/data/*.json`.
2. Surface them in Astro components (see `@/lib/data.ts`).
3. Localize the surrounding copy via MDX.

Need real integrations? Connect to REST/GraphQL in MDX frontmatter `load()` functions or create islands for dashboard widgets.
