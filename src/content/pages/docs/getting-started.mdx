---

# Getting Started

## 1. Create a Project

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template affiliatefm/website-core-template
cd your-project
make install && make bootstrap && make seed
```

`make bootstrap` writes `affiliatefm.core.json` (core version + protected paths) and prepares `src/data/`. Update `protectedPaths` if you need to shield custom directories.

## 2. Run the Stack

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev` | Start Astro dev server |
| `make build` | Static build + HTML prettify |
| `make preview` | Preview production build |
| `make check` | `astro check` for TS/MDX typing |
| `make seed` | Refresh demo data in `src/data/` |
| `make update` | Pull latest Affiliate.FM core |

Prefer npm? Every make target simply proxies `npm run <script>`.

## 3. Add Content + Locales

- Default locale lives directly under `src/content/pages/`.
- Add `src/content/pages/<locale>/` for each translation. Astro’s file-based routing + our helper utilities auto-link translations.
- Use `alternates` in frontmatter whenever slugs differ across locales.

## 4. Data & Components

- Store structured data under `src/data/` (JSON). Protected by default.
- Consume via `@/lib/data` or build your own helpers.
- Include UI like `<DataShowcase />` directly inside MDX.

## 5. Safe Upgrades

`make update` downloads the latest template into `.affiliatefm/core-latest`, copies “core” paths, and skips everything listed in `protectedPaths`. Inspect the diff, reinstall dependencies if the lockfile changed, then redeploy.

Need more locales, new layouts, or AI-assisted translations? Check `src/config/site.ts`, `src/layouts/*`, and the bundled `@affiliate.fm/astro-content-ai-translator` integration to keep everything in sync.
