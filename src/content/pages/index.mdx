description: Minimal Astro 5 baseline. Seed the full demo whenever you’re ready.

# Welcome to the Affiliate.FM Core

This is the clean baseline: one locale, one page, no sample data. Add your own content right away or load the full multilingual demo when you want a reference implementation.

```bash
make seed   # lays down the full Affiliate.FM example
```

## Next Steps

- Update `src/config/site.ts` with your branding and navigation.
- Drop new pages into `src/content/pages/`.
- Expand locales by editing `locales`/`localeLabels`.
- Run `make bootstrap` once to generate `affiliatefm.core.json`, then `make update` whenever you need the latest core files.
