# User Template Placeholder

This folder demonstrates a user-owned template slot.
It contains documentation only and will be preserved by `make update`.

To create your own template:
1. Copy this folder and rename it to `src/templates/_your-template`.
2. Add `layout.astro` and page templates as needed.
3. Set `template` in `src/data/site.ts` to the folder name (including the `_`).
